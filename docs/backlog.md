- As a librarian I want to register a copy of a book available to lend, by scanning book ISBN and the bar code
    - The bar code is printed in the libary and pasted on each copy of the book. Each copy has its own unique bar code
    - If the book is not yet in the catalog, it should be added there with information about the title and ISBN

- As a library user, I want to borrow a copy of a book. I want to know up until when I can hold the book so I don't pay a fee

- As a library user, I want to return a copy of a book I borrowed. If the book is returned after the return date, I must pay a fee

* There is a 3rd party service that returns book information based on the isbn code: isbndb.com


* Bring in Spring Security to handle authentication
